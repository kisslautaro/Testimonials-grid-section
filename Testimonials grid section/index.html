I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”

An overall wonderful and rewarding experience

“ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living

Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
learning from their experiences was easy.

“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
